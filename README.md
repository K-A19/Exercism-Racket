# Exercism Racket Solutions 🧠🐍


Welcome! This repo contains my solutions to the [Exercism Racket track](https://exercism.org/tracks/racket) — a collection of coding challenges designed to help you learn functional programming through Racket.

## 🚀 Why Racket?
Well, I'm on my way to Waterloo, where they're convinced that Racket is a powerful Lisp-based language that makes recursion, functional design, and abstract thinking fun and challenging. This repo tracks my progress and improvements as I tackle each exercise.

## 📁 Structure
Each file contains:
- ✅ My solution (`.rkt` file)
- 📄 Problem statement (included as comment)
- 💭 Notes or reflections (sometimes!)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- VS Code + Magic Racket for editing
- Git for version control

## ✨ Goals
- Practice recursion and functional problem-solving
- Write Racket over summer
- Have fun while learning
